The `libs` folder in the project contains files that provide utility or integration functionalities, often abstracting the underlying libraries or services used by the application. Let's explore the functionality of the specific files you mentioned:

1. **prismadb.ts**: The `prismadb.ts` file likely provides a wrapper or configuration for interacting with the Prisma database. Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions by providing a type-safe and query-building interface. The `prismadb.ts` file may include the Prisma client initialization, connection configuration, and any additional utility functions or configurations related to database operations. It enables the application to connect to the database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and interact with the database schema defined in Prisma.

2. **pusher.ts**: The `pusher.ts` file likely provides integration with the Pusher service, which facilitates real-time communication and event broadcasting. Pusher allows applications to send and receive real-time messages and updates between clients. The `pusher.ts` file may include configuration settings, initialization of the Pusher client, and utility functions or wrappers for interacting with Pusher's API. It enables the application to establish connections with Pusher channels, subscribe to events, and trigger events to notify clients about updates or changes.

By abstracting the underlying libraries or services, the `libs` folder helps decouple the application's codebase from specific implementations or external dependencies. It provides a central location to configure and integrate with external tools or services, enabling easier maintenance, testing, and potential future changes or replacements of the underlying libraries or services.

In addition to the specific files mentioned, the `libs` folder may contain other utility files, configurations, or wrappers that provide integration with other third-party services or libraries used in the project. These files assist in abstracting away complexities, encapsulating integration logic, and providing a clean interface for other parts of the application to interact with the external tools or services.

Overall, the `libs` folder plays a vital role in simplifying integrations, enhancing code organization, and promoting decoupling from specific libraries or services, making the application more modular, maintainable, and adaptable.
